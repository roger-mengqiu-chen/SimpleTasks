# SimpleTasks

Tasks management web application. It is deployed at: [https://cr-tasks-app.herokuapp.com/](https://cr-tasks-app.herokuapp.com/). Loading can be slow (30s) because I'm using the free dyno, which can be hibernated by Heroku. 

This small project demonstrates how to use state in ReactJS. 

More features will be added to this Mini application. 

- [x] Add user and priority for each task
- [x] Add modal to indicate input error (may be removed in the future)
- [ ] User login
- [ ] Database storage
