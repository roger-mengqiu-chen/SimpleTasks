# SimpleTasks

Tasks management web application. It is deployed at: [https://cr-tasks-app.herokuapp.com/](https://cr-tasks-app.herokuapp.com/). Loading can be slow (30s) because I'm using the free dyno, which can be hibernated by Heroku. 

This small project demonstrates how to use hooks in ReactJS. 

Now the app has user function and task management function. 

You can login with any account and password as it doesn't have authentication function. 

More features will be added to this Mini application. 

- [x] Add user and priority for each task
- [x] Add modal to indicate input error (may be removed in the future)
- [x] User login
- [ ] User validation
- [ ] Database storage
